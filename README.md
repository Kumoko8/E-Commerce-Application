# E-Commerce Application

 
  ## Description

 
     This project is designed to create the back-end of an application using sequelize to allow users to interact with a SQL database more efficiently and effectively. I learned a lot about how sequelize methods make queries much  easier. I also got practice building routes and connecting the back-end server with the front end html.
